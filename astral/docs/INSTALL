This document contains instructions for installing Astral

For information on the capabilities and features of Astral, see the file
README in the top-level directory of the Astral distribution.


Obtaining Astral
==================

Astral can be obtained from:

   http://www.oak-wood.co.uk/oss/astral/


Bleeding-edge development versions of Astral are available via Git:

  https://github.com/tipichris/Astral/


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Astral **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Astral runs within the `Horde Application Framework`, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Astral.

   .. Important:: Astral 1.0 requires version 3.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. `Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Astral's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Astral.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

3. The following PEAR packages:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR packages)

4. The following PECL modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PECL modules)

5. Asterisk

Astral needs to have access to the Asterisk Manager interface, which it
connects to using TCP. You will need to add a file something like this to
/etc/asterisk/manager.d/ (or whereever that directory is on your
distro):

[horde]
secret=secretpassword
read=call
write=call

If Horde and Asterisk are not running on the same host, adjust
/etc/asterisk/manager.conf accordingly. By default, Asterisk Manager listens
only on localhost.


Installing Astral
=================

Astral is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Conventionally, Astral is installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Astral is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/astral-h3-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv astral-h3-x.y.z astral

If using LDAP for storing preferences, you will need to patch the
horde.schema used by your LDAP server. A patch is included in the distribution
in scripts/ldap.


Configuring Astral
====================

1. Configuring Horde for Astral

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.d/astral.php``, find the ``applications['astral']``
      stanza. The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired. If you have changed the location of Astral relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update
      the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Creating the database tables

   The specific steps to create Astrals's database tables depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   Astral uses a database only for preference storage. For SQL preference
   storage your existing Horde database should suffice.

   If using LDAP for storing preferences, you will need to patch the
   horde.schema used by your LDAP server. A patch is included in the distribution
   in scripts/ldap/.

3. Configuring Astral

   To configure Astral, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file. You may edit these files if you wish to customize Astral's
   appearance and behavior.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Astral. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page. Select ``Asterisk Dialer`` from the
   selection list of applications. Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed. When done click on ``Generate Asterisk Dialer Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Astral configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``astral/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Astral uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory. If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

4. User configuration.

   Before a user can use Astral to place phone calls, they must configure
   the device which will be used as the source of their phone calls. This
   is done from the Options for Asterisk Dialer. Valid entries are any
   Asterisk channel, for example:

     SIP/myphone
     IAX2/myphone
     ZAP/5

5. Securing

   Astral communicates with the Asterisk Manager using TCP. All passwords are
   sent in clear text. If your Asterisk installation is not on the same
   machine as your Horde installation (likely on all but small scale setups)
   you should consider carefully the security implications of this. You may
   wish to use an SSH tunnel or other means to secure the communications
   channel.

Known Problems
==============
Astral can not cope with address book entries that include extension numbers
eg
  01234 567890 ext 123
